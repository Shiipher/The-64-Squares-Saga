# The-64-Squares-Saga
This Python chess game uses Pygame for its GUI and offers two modes: play against a human or AI. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a depth of 3. An 8x8 2D array models the chessboard, storing 64 GameTile objects, each holding a tile number and a chess piece.
